# whoami?
sebastian

# what's this about?
i like getting into random stuff. apparently, making a minimal blog was part of it. so i did that and now I am stuck with it, haha. for real though, i will try to make a habit of posting about the random stuff that piques my interests. if anyone stumbled upon this site and actually reads this stuff, i would be truly surprised - but I'll also be happy if someone appreciates what I've put on this website. at the time of writing this intro, there is nothing on here.

# why don't you just use facebook/twitter/myspace or the new flavor of the month social media experiment?
it's more fun this way, i get to play with tech and dictate all the content. this means here we are free of tracking nonsense and targeted ads for your dental hygiene. **for now.**

# how was this made?
this page was made with zola, a static-site-generator build with rust and it's after-theme, which I minimally altered. at the moment, it is built and hosted with github pages.
