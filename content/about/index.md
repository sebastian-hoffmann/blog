# whoami?

sebastian

# what's this about?

i like getting into random stuff. apparently, making a minimal blog was part of it. so i did that and now I am stuck with it, haha. for real though, i will try to make a habit of posting about the random stuff that piques my interests - or just whatever floats my boat. maybe i'll put a short story up, i am keeping this wide open. if anyone stumbled upon this site and actually reads this stuff, i would be truly surprised - but I'll also be happy if someone appreciates my ramblings. at the time of writing this intro, there is nothing on here.

my interestis include
* reading, mostly fantasy and sci-fi as well as excessively consuming all sorts of contemporary media
* various topics of system administration, especially automation and cybersecurity
* expanding my culinary horizons, actively and passively
* engaging in lavish pseudo-intellectualism
* world peace (we probably should all be interested in that, shouldn't we?)

# why don't you just use facebook/twitter/myspace or the new flavor of the month social media experiment?

it's more fun this way, i get to play with tech and dictate **all** the content. this means here we are free of tracking nonsense and targeted ads for your dental hygiene. **for now.**

# how was this made?

this page was made with zola, a static-site-generator build with rust and its awesome after-dark theme, which I minimally altered. at the moment, it is built and hosted with github pages but this might change and i might forget to update this page so there's that.

all the posts are written in markdown.

# anything else?
