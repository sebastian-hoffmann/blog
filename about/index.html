<p>i like getting into random stuff. apparently, making a minimal blog was part of it. so i did that and now I am stuck with it, haha. for real though, i will try to make a habit of posting about the random stuff that piques my interests - or just whatever floats my boat. maybe i'll put a short story up, i am keeping this wide open. if anyone stumbled upon this site and actually reads this stuff, i would be truly surprised - but I'll also be happy if someone appreciates my ramblings. at the time of writing this intro, there is nothing on here.</p>
<p>my interestis include</p>
<ul>
<li>reading, mostly fantasy and sci-fi as well as excessively consuming all sorts of contemporary media</li>
<li>various topics of system administration, especially automation and cybersecurity</li>
<li>expanding my culinary horizons, actively and passively</li>
<li>engaging in lavish pseudo-intellectualism</li>
<li>world peace (we probably should all be interested in that, shouldn't we?)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="why-don-t-you-just-use-facebook-twitter-myspace-or-the-new-flavor-of-the-month-social-media-experiment">why don't you just use facebook/twitter/myspace or the new flavor of the month social media experiment?</h1>
<p>it's more fun this way, i get to play with tech and dictate <strong>all</strong> the content. this means here we are free of tracking nonsense and targeted ads for your dental hygiene. <strong>for now.</strong></p>
<h1 id="how-was-this-made">how was this made?</h1>
<p>this page was made with zola, a static-site-generator build with rust and its awesome after-dark theme, which I minimally altered. at the moment, it is built and hosted with github pages but this might change and i might forget to update this page so there's that.</p>
<p>all the posts are written in markdown.</p>
<h1 id="anything-else">anything else?</h1>
<p>if you have found some kinds of errors on this page or you want to shout at me because I said something stupid, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at blog(at)h0ffmann.at</p>
